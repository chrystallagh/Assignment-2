 * Write a program that uses a structure to store the following data on a 
 * company division:
 * Division Name (such as East, West, North, or South) Quarter (1, 2, 3, or 4)
 * Quarterly Sales
 * The user should be asked for the four quartersâ€™ sales figures for the East,
 *  West, North, and South divisions. The data for each quarter for each 
 * division should be written to a file.
 * Input Validation: Do not accept negative numbers for any sales figures.
